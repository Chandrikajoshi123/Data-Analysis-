# Global Online Learning Insights

This project analyzes trends in global online education using course usage data from major MOOC platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX.

We focus on understanding:
- Which platforms have grown over time
- What topics are in demand in different countries
- How user behavior (enrollment, ratings, completion) varies across platforms

The goal is to build clear, actionable insights using Python and visualize them through an interactive dashboard.
